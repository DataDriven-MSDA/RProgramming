# **Mushroom Data Study**

## Summary

This is an R Markdown document for providing documentation for performing **Data Transformation on the Mushroom DataSet**

Attempted to study data that comprises of **Edible** as well as **Poisonous** mushrooms.
Hence observations selected comprise of mushrooms that grow in **Grasses** or **Meadows** Habitat
and mushrooms that have an odor which is either like **Almond** or **Pungent**.

Following attributes are extracted and mapped to the explicit values for the observations selected as above, from the **Mushroom Dataset**:

- **Class :** 
     - *e: Edible*
     - *p: Poisonous*
- **Cap Shape :**
     - *b: Bell*
     - *c: Conical*
     - *x: Convex*
     - *f: Flat*
     - *k: Knobbed*
     - *s: Sunken*
- **Cap Surface :**
     - *f: Fibrous*
     - *g: Grooves*
     - *y: Scaly*
     - *s: Smooth*
- **Cap Color :**
     - *n: Brown*
     - *b: Buff*
     - *c: Cinnamon*
     - *g: Gray*
     - *r: Green*
     - *p: Pink*
     - *u: Purple*
     - *e: Red*
     - *w: White*
     - *y: Yellow*
- **Odor :**
     - *a: Almond*
     - *p: Pungent*
- **Stalk Shape :**
     - *e: Enlarging*
     - *t: Tapering*
- **Stalk Root :**
     - *b: Bulbous*
     - *c: Club*
     - *u: Cup*
     - *e: Equal*
     - *z: Rhizomorphs*
     - *r: Rooted*
     - *?: Missing*
- **Spore Color :**
     - *k: Black*
     - *n: Brown*
     - *b: Buff*
     - *h: Chocolate*
     - *r: Green*
     - *o: Orange*

## R Code For Data Transformation Of Mushroom Dataset

```{r include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)

##################################################################################################
# @ Kumudini Bhave 
# R Bridge Course Week 3 
# Data Transformation for Mushroom Dataset
#
# This code provides the set of instructions to access, explore and transform the Mushroom Dataset
# 
# Libraries Used : RCurl
# ################################################################################################

```


### Extracting Raw Data From GitHub Data File And Reading In CSV Format

```{r}

# Loading RCurl package to help scrape data from web (stored on GitHub).
library(RCurl)

# Loading plyr package to help map abbreviated values to explained.
library(plyr)

data.giturl <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataDriven-MSDA/RProgramming/master/agaricus-lepiota.data"
mushroom.gitdata <- getURL(data.giturl)
mushroom.gitdata.csv <- read.csv(text=mushroom.gitdata, header=F, sep=",",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

```



### Extracting Select Attributes For Mushroom Study


```{r results='hide' }

# Attempt to study data that comprises of edible as well as poisonous mushrooms.
# Hence observations selected comprise of mushroom habitat in grasses or meadows 
# and mushroom odor either almond like or pungent

mushroom.datastudy <- subset(mushroom.gitdata.csv,(V23=="g" | V23 == "m") & (V6 == "a" | V6 == "p"),select=c(V1,V2,V3,V4,V6,V11,V12,V21,V22,V23))

# Verifying the number of attributes
length(mushroom.datastudy)
# Verifying the number of observations selected
nrow(mushroom.datastudy)

```


### Renaming Selected Attributes 
```{r}
# Naming the Attributes selected for study
colnames(mushroom.datastudy) <- c("Class","CapShape","CapSurface","CapColor","Odor","StalkShape","StalkRoot","SporeColor","Population","Habitat")

```

### Mapping Abbreviated Values For Selected Attributes 

```{r}
# Mapping the attributes from abbreviated to explanatory
```

##### Class
  
```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=180)}
mushroom.datastudy$Class[mushroom.datastudy$Class == "e"] <- "Edible"
mushroom.datastudy$Class[mushroom.datastudy$Class == "p"] <- "Poisonous"

## Can also be mapped as follows for larger set of values for an attribute
mushroom.datastudy$Class <- mapvalues(mushroom.datastudy$Class,
                                           from=c("e","p"),
